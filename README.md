# Brick geometry defect recognition system
This project is aimed at analyzing the received images from the conveyor and comparing them with the reference object. The result of the program is the answer whether the object meets the specified requirements.
# Layout of the conveyor line on Unity
The Unity asset contains a conveyor line with cameras and a mechanism for influencing the object. The same message occurs with Unity using the ZeroMQ library.
This asset captures the image of a brick and sends a command to start processing with Unity scripts, receiving instructions on further actions in response.
